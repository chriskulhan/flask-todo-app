# flask-todo-app

#Need to run these three things individually in terminal after opening, before you can run app.py:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  
pip install flask flask-sqlalchemy

**important: When you try to run app.py, it's easiest/best to do it in terminal. Make sure you are in "bash" and then type:
 python app.py and you will be asked if you want open a port in a new browser. Say yes, and you'll be able to see your page and
 interact with it!!! :-)
